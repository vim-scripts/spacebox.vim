DESCRIPTION						*spacebox*

Spacebox allows you to select a Visual block of indentation whitespace based
on the indentation of the current line.  In the following code fragment, when
the cursor is resting on "200", |:SpaceBox| selects the Visual block marked by
the middots. >

    foreach my $q (@$questions) {
	if ($q->answered()) {
    ········my $upvotes = 0;
    ········foreach (@{ $q->answers() }) { $upvotes += $_->upvotes() }
    ········
    ········push @good_answers, $q if $upvotes > 200;
    
	}
    }

As the example shows, blank lines (and their indentation whitespace) are
included in the selection by default.  On the other hand, blank lines at the
upper and lower boundaries of the block are not included.

On a line with no indentation the behaviour of the command changes:  There it
will select adjacent unindented lines.

USAGE							*:SpaceBox*

The spacebox plugin provides a single command to do the selection in blockwise
Visual mode as explained above. >

    :SpaceBox

For ease of use, you might want to put a line similar to the following in your
|vimrc|.  Then just hit "\w" to trigger |:SpaceBox|. >

    nnoremap <Leader>w :SpaceBox<CR>

Some uses I have found for the plugin are "\w>" and "\w<" to fix indentation,
and "\wV" on an unindented line to select stretches of here-documents.

Note that Spacebox may seem to do the wrong thing on input with less sane
whitespace conventions, for example the Vim help files where spaces and tabs
are freely mixed.  This is due to the fact that Vim cannot by default only
select part of a tab in blockwise Visual mode.  You can work around this by
temporarily setting 'virtualedit' to "all".

CONFIGURATION						*spacebox-config*

Two global variables control whether or not Spacebox skips over blank lines.

					*g:spacebox_skip_blank_lines*
    g:spacebox_skip_blank_lines ~
    Skip blank lines.
    Default is 1.

					*g:spacebox_skip_blank_lines_noindent*
    g:spacebox_skip_blank_lines_noindent ~
    Skip blank lines when running |:SpaceBox| on an unindented line.
    Default is 0.

To change the default settings, set these variables to "1" or "0" in your
|vimrc|.  Please note that blank lines at the top and bottom are never
included in the selection.
