DESCRIPTION						*spacebox*

Spacebox allows you to select a Visual block of indentation whitespace based
on the indentation of the current line.  In the following code fragment, when
the cursor is resting on "200", |:SpaceBox| selects the Visual block marked by
the middots. >

    foreach my $q (@$questions) {
	if ($q->answered()) {
    ········my $upvotes = 0;
    ········foreach (@{ $q->answers() }) { $upvotes += $_->upvotes() }
    ········
    ········push @good_answers, $q if $upvotes > 200;
    
	}
    }

As the example shows, blank lines (and their indentation whitespace) are
included in the selection.  On the other hand, blank lines at the upper and
lower boundaries of the block are not included.

USAGE							*:SpaceBox*

The spacebox plugin provides a single command which selects a block of
indentation whitespace in blockwise Visual mode as explained above. >

    :SpaceBox

For ease of use, you might want to put a line similar to the following in your
|vimrc|.  Then just hit "\w" to trigger |:SpaceBox|. >

    nmap <Leader>w :SpaceBox<CR>
